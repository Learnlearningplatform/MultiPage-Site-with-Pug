# MultiPage Site with Pug
 Pug is one of the most popular templating engines for Node. It is also commonly used with Express and it is the templating engine of choice.
 Pug is a language that compiles or translates to HTML. Instead of using HTML opening and closing tags to describe elements, you just type the tag name a space, and then content that you want to appear inside that tag.
